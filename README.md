# milliyet-archive
This script is used to fetch data from the Milliyet Newspaper Archive (https://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr) based on a specific date input by the user.

### How it works
The script prompts the user to input a date in the format 'YYYY.MM.DD'. It then constructs a URL using the input date and sends a GET request to the Milliyet Newspaper Archive. The headers for the request are predefined in the script.

### Dependencies
This script requires the following Python libraries:

* requests: Used to send the HTTP request.
* img2pdf: Used for converting images to PDF.
### Usage
To use this script, simply run it in a Python environment. When prompted, input a date in the 'YYYY.MM.DD' format. The script will then fetch data from the Milliyet Newspaper Archive for that date.
